# ML-Website

The main point of this was not to train a useful or good machine learning algorithm,
but rather to learn scikit's built in pipeline, storing models using pickle,
and making a website with flask and HTML to interact with the model.

Using data from Capital Bikeshare Washinton 2016, obtained from kaggle.com.

The app will launch a local website the will let the user input values for the ML model,
and return a predicted number of cyclists in Washington that day, based on the users input.

NOTE: that the point was to learn scikit's pipeline and pickle, model itself is not a good model.
